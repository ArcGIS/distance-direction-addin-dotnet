### Working with the Add-In

## Development Environment 

* Building
	* To Build Using Visual Studio
		* Open and build solution file
	* To use MSBuild to build the solution
		* Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt: Start Menu | Visual Studio 2013 | Visual Studio Tools | Developer Command Prompt for VS2013
		* ` cd distance-and-direction-addin-dotnet\source\DistanceAndDirection\ArcMapAddinDistanceAndDirection `
		* ` msbuild ArcMapAddinDistanceAndDirection.sln /property:Configuration=Release `
	* To run Unit test from command prompt
		* Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt: Start Menu | Visual Studio 2013 | Visual Studio Tools | Developer Command Prompt for VS2013
		* ` cd distance-direction-addin-dotnet\source\DistanceAndDirection\ArcMapAddinDistanceAndDirection.Tests\bin\Release `
		* ` MSTest /testcontainer:ArcMapAddinDistanceAndDirection.Tests.dll `* 
	* Note : Assembly references are based on a default install of the SDK, you may have to update the references if you chose an alternate install option

## Desktop Users
* Running the add-in
	* To run from a stand-alone deployment
		* ArcMap
			* Install the add-in from the latest Release on Github (https://github.com/Esri/distance-direction-addin-dotnet/releases)
			* Add the add-in command to a toolbar via menu option 
				* **Customize** -> **Customize mode**
				* Select **Commands** Tab
				* Select **Add-In Controls**
				* Drag/Drop **Show Distance and Direction** command onto a toolbar
				* Close customize mode
				* Open tool by clicking the **Show Distance and Direction** command you just added
				* Dockable *Distance and Direction* tool appears
				* If you add this to a toolbar that you contstantly use the add-in will stay. To remove the add-in delete your [Normal.MXT](https://geonet.esri.com/thread/78692) file
				
## Workflows

3. Start an interactive session by selecting the **Map Point Tool** (arrow icon) 
4. Enter a starting and ending point on the map by clicking on the map
5. Repeat until all desired graphics have been included
6. Optional - Select the Save As button to export the Line features to a file geodatabase, shapefile, or KML

### Create Lines from Known Coordinates
1. Choose the type of line that is needed to be created
2. Input the **Starting Point** where your line is going to start
3. Input the **Ending Point** of where your line is going to end
