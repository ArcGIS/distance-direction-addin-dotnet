### Working with the Add-In

## Development Environment 

* Building
	* To Build Using Visual Studio
		* Open and build solution file
	* To use MSBuild to build the solution
		* Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt: Start Menu | Visual Studio 2013 | Visual Studio Tools | Developer Command Prompt for VS2013
		* ``` cd geodesy-and-range-addin-dotnet\source\GeodesyAndRange\ArcMapAddinGeodesyAndRange ```
		* ``` msbuild ArcMapAddinGeodesyAndRange.sln /property:Configuration=Release ```
	* Note : Assembly references are based on a default install of the SDK, you may have to update the references if you chose an alternate install option

## Desktop Users
* Running the add-in
	* To run from a stand-alone deployment
		* ArcMap
			* Install the add-in from the application folder by double clicking the add-in
			* Add the add-in command to a toolbar via menu option 
				* "Customize -> Customize mode"
				* Select "Commands" Tab
				* Select "Add-In Controls"
				* Drag/Drop "Show Geodesy and Range" command onto a toolbar
				* Close customize mode
				* Open tool by clicking the "Show Geodesy and Range" command you just added
				* Dockable geodesy and range tool appears
				* If you add this to a toolbar that you contstantly use the add-in will stay. To remove the add-in delete your [Normal.MXT](https://geonet.esri.com/thread/78692) file

## Usage

* Create Lines Interactively 
	* Choose the Lines tab on the Geodesy and Range Tool
	* Choose the type of line that is needed to be created
	* Start an interactive session by selecting the arrow icon 
	* Enter a starting and ending point on the map by clicking on the map
	* Repeat until all desired graphics have been included

* Create Lines from Known Coordinates
	* Choose the type of line that is needed to be created
	* Input the first coordinate of where your line is going to start
	* Input the second coordinate of where your line is going to end
	* Press "Enter" key and the graphic will be drawn on the map
	* Repeat until all desired graphics have been included. 

* Create a Line with a Range and Bearing
	* Choose the type of line that you would like the create
